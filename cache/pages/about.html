<p>I'm Emily. I value kindness, ice cream, books, time outdoors, and creating things. I can easily pass an hour or more just petting and talking to one or both of my pets. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life when I graduated college, other than make the world a little bit better somehow. I'm still trying to do that, and for me leading teams in the data space has felt like a good path.</p>
<p>As to this website, check out <a class="reference external" href="link://slug/why-now">why now</a>. It's made with <a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com">Nikola</a> because I like python &amp; the MIT license. I'm using the base theme for its simplicity. I made the favicon using Figma. I'm using GitHub Pages because it's so darn easy, and GitHub Actions enables auto-deploy in a way that will let me write from anywhere. I'll be on a different domain starting sometime in May because the whole &quot;Bailey&quot; thing is going to be obsolete soon.</p>
