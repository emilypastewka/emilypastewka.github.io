# About

I'm Emily. I value kindness, time outdoors, and creating things. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life when I graduated college, other than make the world a little bit better somehow. I'm still trying to do that, and for me leading teams in the data space has felt like a good path.

As to this website, check out [why now](../../posts/why-now/). It's also worth noting that each page is meant to be, to some extent, a living document. I like to footnote as my thinking evolves and cross-link to new posts if they're relevant. I don't usually note when such edits are made because every edit is visible on my [public GitHub](https://github.com/emilypastewka/emilypastewka.github.io). On that note, this site was originally made with [Nikola](https://getnikola.com) because I like python & the MIT license, but despite being _far_ from a front-end expert, I've strayed from the framework over time. I made the favicon using Figma. I'm using GitHub Pages because it's so darn easy. My name [got longer](https://www.instagram.com/p/CdEbaHEPDWB/) in April of 2022.
