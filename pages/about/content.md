I'm Emily. I value kindness, ice cream, books, time outdoors, and creating things. I can easily pass an hour or more just petting and talking to one or both of my pets. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life when I graduated college, other than make the world a little bit better somehow. I'm still trying to do that, and for me leading teams in the data space has felt like a good path.

As to this website, check out [why now](../../posts/why-now/). It was originally made with [Nikola](https://getnikola.com) because I like python & the MIT license, but I've strayed from the framework over time. I made the favicon using Figma. I'm using GitHub Pages because it's so darn easy. I should switch to a different domain soon because my name got longer this year.
