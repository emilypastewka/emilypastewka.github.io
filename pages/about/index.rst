I'm Emily. I value kindness, ice cream, books, time outdoors, and creating things. I can easily pass an hour or more just petting and talking to one or both of my pets. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life when I graduated college, other than make the world a little bit better somehow. I'm still trying to do that, and for me leading teams in the data space has felt like a good path. 

As to this website, check out `why now <link://slug/why-now>`__. It's made with `Nikola	<https://getnikola.com>`__ because I like python & the MIT license. I'm using the base theme for its simplicity. I made the favicon using Figma; I did something to stop it showing up recently, I'll figure it out soon. I'm using GitHub Pages because it's so darn easy. I'll be on a different domain starting sometime in May because the whole "Bailey" thing is going to be obsolete soon.
