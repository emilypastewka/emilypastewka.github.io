I'm Emily. I value kindness. Staying active helps me feel balanced and creative. I can easily pass an hour or more just petting and talking to one or both of my pets. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life when I graduated college, other than make the world a little bit better somehow. I'm still trying to do that, and for me leading teams in the data space has felt like a good path. 

As to this website, check out `why now <link://slug/why-now>`__. It's made with `Nikola	<https://getnikola.com>`__ because I like python & the MIT license. I'm using the base theme for its simplicity. The favicon is made with Figma.
