# Be an owner not a renter (or a hoarder)

In 2015, <!--nearly all of Uber's global corporate employees convened in Las Vegas to celebrate the company hitting a 10 billion dollar revenue run rate [[0]](#0). In a stadium filled with mostly-hungover mostly-twenty-somethings, -->Travis Kalanick unveiled Uber's fourteen cultural values. One of those original values was "Be an owner, not a renter." It meant committing to seeing a project through, to doing what it took to get it over the line. I connected with this statement immediately. 

When I first graduated college, I took what I thought was my dream job, consulting on environmental and energy projects. I left within six months for a startup and never looked back. I didn't want to give people advice on how to do something, I wanted to build things myself. I wanted to leave inky fingerprints, not a wafting scent in the air [[2]](#2).

Mid-2010s Stitchfix also [celebrated](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2019/03/11/FullStackDS-Generalists/) single-threaded ownership, at least on their [data team](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/03/16/engineers-shouldnt-write-etl/). Ironically, Uber's approach to data work over those same years was far more siloed. While in the early days data scientists wrote their own pipelines, built their own models, ran their own experiments, in the years leading up to 2020 teams had been built to specifically own data engineering, ML implementation, experimentation platform.

I still see both approaches frequently. I still gravitate toward the one that encourages ownership. 

A "full-stack" data scientist who is given real ownership over his/her work will be proud and excited when that work drives impact, when s/he has measured tangible results. These individuals are not just transacting time for money, "renting" their jobs — they are driven by outcomes. They won't wait on someone else to provide or clean data, won't ask someone else to put their model in production or measure its impact through an A/B test. They will learn and do what it takes to make the project they own a success.

Empowerment doesn't work if "ownership" is just nice corporate lingo. It needs to be made true via the setup of the organization and the freedom data scientists are given across the stack. 
- Project expectations should be as clearly defined as roles are broad. [[3]](#3)
- A good set of data tools, a platform designed & maintained for the use of the data team, goes a long way to enabling safe experimentation. 
- [Collaboration](../humility_is_key_to_collaboration/), too, remains a part of the job. Rarely does somebody start a project knowing how to do every step on their own. [Teams must be built so that individuals are able and encouraged to support one another, learning and teaching](../build_teams_of_t_shapes/).

Ownership, of course, is not forever. Despite the very real costs of knowledge transfer, there is a greater cost to pigeonholing a curious, growth-oriented data scientist into a single problem space. In addition, as every technologist knows, [maintenance costs creep up](https://dresscode.renttherunway.com/blog/fix-it-week) over time. No matter how good the platform, if a data scientist owns too many live models, time for new development will be limited. Being an owner does not negate the truth that, at some point, growth requires you to [give away your legos](https://review.firstround.com/give-away-your-legos-and-other-commandments-for-scaling-startups).

Am I still under NDA on this? 🤐 -->
<!-- Oh, you wanted the list?  -->
<!-- vs Dara's new ones https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/07/ubers-new-cultural-norms.html -->

No, of course most of us couldn't remember them all, even back then. When Dara joined, he quickly slimmed the list down from 14 "values" to 8 "norms." The shift did not entirely abandon the essence of "Uber 1.0," only the bits found to be extraneous or responsible for toxicity. "Be an owner, not a renter" simplified to "We act like owners," and as far as I know remains a core piece of Uber's DNA.

This got a lil weird but I still like it.

The question of whether to hire full-stack data practitioners is tightly related to the question of whether to build a centralized team or set of embedded teams. A centralized team can cluster practitioners with the same specialized skills, who can then share knowledge and become excellent at their chosen discipline. Embedded teams can be a collection of individuals who specialize, but often work out better when they are composed of generalists. I have long thought of the answer to the embedded vs. centralized question as being a function of time, a pendulum swinging between opposing pain points. An additional constraint is who is on your team and what they know.

<!-- At Rent the Runway, we built teams around job functions instead of domain knowledge. This partially shifted in late 2022.
