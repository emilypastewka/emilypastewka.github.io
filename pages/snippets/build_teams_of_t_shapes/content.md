# Build teams of T-shaped individuals

In 2014 the data team at Opower did an offsite, and one of the pre-reads we were asked to be ready to discuss was Analyzing the Analyzers: An Introspective Survey of Data Scientists and Their Work [[1]](#1). Considering the term "data scientist" was only birthed about a year before this was published, many of the views it espouses will seem fairly immature today, but one idea has stuck with me continuously. I find myself discussing it with my team, my peers at work and outside of work, recruiters, candidates, mentees/advisees â€” basically any time I am discussing how to build a healthy, performant team I come back to this idea of the [T-shaped data scientist](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/analyzing-the-analyzers/9781449368388/ch04.html#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%9CT%E2%80%9D%20represents%20breadth%20of,effective%20than%20those%20without%20depth.).

As I use the concept today, a "T-shaped" individual in any function is someone who has shallow knowledge covering many if not all aspects of the work s/he does, and incredibly deep knowledge in one of those areas. Ideally, each person on your team has a skillset that defines a unique "T shape" within the group. This also becomes a standard against which to hold candidates during the hiring process.

What are the relevant aspects of the role across which that shallow knowledge is needed? The general answer for a data role is "all the steps of a data project;" the specific answer is "whatever the team s/he is being hired onto needs to be able to do." Determining these categories should leverage your skill ladder/continuum/competencies matrix. 

Why is a team of T-shaped individuals better than a team that is medium-skilled across the board?
- Building a team of individuals who each have a deep strength in something you need ensures that strength actually exists on your team. Ten people who are medium-skilled or medium-knowledgeable at something are not, at times, as useful as one person who knows that thing intimately. 
- [Humility is key to collaboration](../humility_is_key_to_collaboration/) [and growth](../humility_is_key_to_growth/). Being surrounded by people who are better at at least one thing drives humility and thus collaboration on the team.

Why is a team of T-shaped individuals better than a team of people who are fully specialized (and, as a tradeoff, lack certain skills entirely)? 
- An individual with at least some level of depth across the board ensures that person can [own their project end to end](../be_an_owner/).
- Some level of fluency with each vertical creates shared context when partnering with teammates whose T shapes are different.

What are the exceptions?
- Early-career data practitioners may not yet have deep knowledge in any one area. Index instead on depth of interest.
- At some point, you may actually need a true specialist.

<!-- i score people on the attributes and stack everything up as a team
related to your job is a matrix

i use this in determining who to hire next, and when we need to hire - if a new skill need emerges we don't have for instance  -->

The other one was Building Data Science Teams by DJ Patil.

Considering I am still here thinking about these texts nearly a decade later, I would say this was a pretty high-value offsite. Pre-planning clearly helped!
