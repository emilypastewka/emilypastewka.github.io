# Solutions orientation is techno-optimism is cultural reality

We've all heard we should be solution-oriented rather than problem oriented. It strikes me, recently, how incredibly techno-optimistic this mentality is.

I'm not making the argument [Marc Andreessen has been putting out recently](https://pmarca.substack.com/p/the-little-tech-agenda?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email), that giving tech entirely free rein is the only answer to preserving America's shot at greatness. But fighting progress is an uphill battle. And even if progress creates more problems, Ezra Klein makes a point that's hard to argue:
>I just don't believe that there is a political tendency strong enough to overcome the desire for a better life now to avert consequences in the future...I don't really want to have all my chips in on inventing solution after solution to the problems that human beings create, but I don't really think there's a choice.

With this view, looking back on the history of the world, how could one not identify as a techno-optimist? We create problems, yes. But problems spur solutions. Necessity is the mother of invention.
