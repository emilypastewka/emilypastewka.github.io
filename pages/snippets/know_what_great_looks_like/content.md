# Know what "great" looks like, and when "good" is good enough

When people ask what my superpower is, this is usually my answer [[1]](#1). There is a natural tension between getting things done and doing things well [[2]](#2). Both are challenging to accomplish. Both are vital.

In my later years at Uber, every fraction of a percent improvement we made to any algorithm or system translated to millions of dollars of increased revenue, millions more riders and drivers and eaters and couriers and restaurateurs receiving better service. In the early days, we aimed for "good enough" because we were scrambling to build things from scratch. But as the business scaled, we fought for greatness. In these years, we went _deep_ on the problems we tackled. I led teams where I'd have as many as ten data scientists and engineers working on a problem that later in my career (at younger startups) I'd assign to one person as a part-time project, or even do off the side of my desk. 

Today, I ask my teams to start by defining a "great" outcome and at least a sketch of what would get us there for several reasons.
- Prioritization and investment of effort is an optimization problem. Per the NPV rule, every project with positive net present ROI should be taken on. In reality, few companies are staffed to operate this way. Because our teams are constrained by headcount, tooling, and other resources, leaders must  seek the greatest possible ROI on our overall project portfolio subject to those realities. When determining whether to aim for "great" or "good enough" on a given project, I ask whether the marginal value of achieving "great" on project outweighs the opportunity cost of achieving "good enough" on one more project my team could pick up. [[3]](#3)
- In some cases, starting by defining the definition and approach to achieve "great" helps you plot that ROI curve, and you realize that while "great" may not be the right goal, it would actually be well worthwhile to land somewhere between "good enough" and "great." 
- Even if you don't choose to pursue anything beyond "good enough," by mapping out "great" you gain confidence that "good enough" is indeed the right place to land on the ROI curve. [[4]](#4)
- By working backward from "great," you may find a better way to achieve "good enough" than had already been on your mind.
- Whether you choose to pursue "great" now or not, by defining what it looks like and how to get there, you've written your future roadmap for the project.
- By thinking through the problem from more angles, you earn more trust with [your team](../engineering_leaders_do_their_jobs_better_when_their_technical_skills_remain_relevant/) and your peers.
- By thinking through the problem more deeply, your team learns more.
- If you are a data leader, your team probably wants to achieve "great." Optimization sits at the core of performant algorithms, the march toward "great" is inescapably embedded in the job. Even if you aren't a data leader, people like to know they are doing good work. Maybe you don't choose "great" this time, but your team knows it's out there and that they are good enough to have defined it. 
- The exception: in some cases, there is no real need to know what "great" looks like â€” if you know the threshold for "good enough" and that it will hold forevermore,onward! 


<!-- Let's contextualize this with the ever-popular 80/20 rule: what are you taking 80% of? If there is a maximum possible outcome that you can compute, then it's pretty easy to know what 80% of that goal would be. But if the maximum outcome approaches infinity, a better approach is to plan out the ideal approach and cut  -->

In the past I've said my superpower is that I've done [every modern data role](../build_teams_of_t_shapes/), but really that's just the _how_ behind knowing what "great" looks like and how to get to "good enough."

In some cases, you may be tempted to aim for "good enough" when "great" is worthwhile. The [broad scope of your job](../view_your_job_as_a_matrix/) may make you forget that not all aspects are created equal. Sometimes you need to [focus on one thing and land it](../focus_on_one_thing_land_it/).

As simple as this sounds, the ability to embrace "good enough" is a skill, and it needs to be developed. As I wrote about in [November of 2022](../../../posts/ml_products_today_tomorrow/), there are things you'll learn at a startup that you're less likely to learn elsewhere. This is one of them.
