# Constraints drive creativity

> Scholars define creativity as the production of something both novel and appropriate. (That latter condition is important from a research perspective: "If _anything_ new qualifies as creative, then the term loses its meaning," Kaufman [James C. Kaufman, an associate professor of psychology at California State University at San Bernardino and author of _Creativity 101_] says. "Suppose the person you hired to repave your driveway covered it with salami—that would be original, surely, but inappropriate." Similarly, an innovative design for a bridge would not pass muster if, once constructed, it collapsed.)

In this same vein: there is freedom in structure.

> Bad processes cause bloat, but good processes help provide clarity, which leads to faster execution.
