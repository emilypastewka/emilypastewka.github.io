# Data work is cyclical

There are natural ebbs & flows in most projects. In ML projects, those cycles tend to look quite similar. This image from the Uber Michaelangelo team provides a good summary: https://blogapi.uber.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image6-32.png

Travis Kalanick used to talk about working as close to your "red line" as possible without going over. In data work, I've found that I'm at or above my red line during certain stages, but well below at others. That knowledge (1) helps me get through the peak periods and (2) helps me plan when I'll tackle side projects, learn something new, or take a vacation. Thinking about my team's work this way helps me calibrate what work I assign to whom, and when.
