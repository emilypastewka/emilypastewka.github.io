# Life is curve balls

"_The only constant in life is change_" feels a little too gentle when the changes thrown at us lately have included a global pandemic, a NATO-adjacent war, a resulting economic peak and fast-follow recession, a burning and [flooding](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTYR3bKFKQz/) planet. On a personal level these events have impacted us with unexpected deaths, layoffs, displacement â€” and also opportunities.

Uncertainty seems no longer constant, but increasing with time.

This is not meant to diminish a practice of [continuous improvement](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTYR3bKFKQz/) (or another Heraclitus quote, "_day by day, what you choose, what you think and what you do is who you become_"). But curve balls have the power to wash all progress away, or negate the relevance of the work entirely. How we approach and handle these events therefore has an outsize effect on our happiness.
