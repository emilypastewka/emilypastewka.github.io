# Transactive memory

I don't remember some things because I trust that my calendar or note-taking app has that information. More interestingly, I don't remember other things because I trust that my husband has them covered. I am deeply grateful for this, because running a household is challenging and I appreciate being able to share the work, including the [mental load](https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/).

At work, I struggle to embrace this in the same way. When a job is completely different from mine, I can easily accept that someone else should do it. When there is overlap, my impostor syndrome pipes up and says I shouldn't need help, I should know all of this and remember it all perfectly.

Somehow, reframing this need for support as "transactive memory" has helped recently, perhaps because I am a sucker for clear terminology and this phrase just really resonates ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

As described by Wikipedia:
> This concept proposed that when two individuals spend a lot of time around each other and work together, they create a shared store of knowledge between the members.

To me, this essentially defines an [efficient](../view_your_job_as_a_matrix/), trust-based, [ego-less](../humility_is_key_to_collaboration/) relationship. What's not to love? And how can I intentionally make better use of this magic? I still want to learn and grow at work, so this doesn't imply that I need to learn to "stay in my lane." It also doesn't imply that I should feel free to show up at meetings totally unprepared, assuming someone else has got things fully under control. My perspective will still differ from others' and thereby [adds value](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_diversity_makes_us_smarter).

What transactive memory allows is for me to prioritize more effectively, because I'm more aware of where others are able to jump in vs. where I am the sole owner of a space. [Life is tradeoffs](../life_is_tradeoffs/), and with this perspective my collective team's knowledge becomes a key factor into my time management decisions.
