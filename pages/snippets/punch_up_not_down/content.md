This is not to say you shouldn't be transparent, be willing to pivot, or give valuable feedback. It's not saying you shouldn't delegate. It's saying that you, as the layer between your team the rest of the organization, have a responsibility for their wellbeing. It's a reminder that you must constantly be earning their trust. It's highlighting the importance of leveraging your accreted knowledge and effectively managing up.
