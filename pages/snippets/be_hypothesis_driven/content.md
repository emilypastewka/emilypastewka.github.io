# Be hypothesis driven

One of the best pieces of advice I got as an early-career data analyst was "be hypothesis-driven" [[1]](#1).

Starting any piece of data work with a hypothesis requires having a mental model of the problem space. Approaching an analysis or modeling problem as a series of hypothesis tests implies continuously updating this mental model. The hypothesis-driven approach keeps your mind and your work organized: it provides clear direction, enables an efficient process and makes storytelling easier upon conclusion.

Importantly, hypothesis-driven analysis does not preclude open-mindedness and genuine curiosity about what findings may emerge. Consider, for example, a product manager partering with a data scientist to understand the impact of a new feature release. Before launch, she (hopefully) has guided experiment setup based on strong hypotheses about how key metrics will move. She may also have identified metrics of interest about which she has weaker hypotheses, but strong curiosity about their relationship to the hero metrics [[2]](#2). When measuring the results of the experiment, these additional metrics may provide insight into a finding that refutes one or more of her original hypotheses and inspiration for the next iteration of the feature. 

Life, too, is a hypothesis-driven adventure. Whether we clearly state them or not, every decision we make is based on expectations of what the result of that decision will be. Practicing clearly stating these hypotheses helps us notice when a natural experiment has concluded and we have learned something new.
