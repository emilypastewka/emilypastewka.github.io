# Engineering leaders do their jobs better when their technical skills remain relevant

> Most Engineers want to work for someone who understands what they are doing at a deeper level, and not for an organizational placeholder.

I have found this to be true throughout my career, and for any kind of technical roles (e.g. data science and analytics in addition to engineering). I am always open with my teams that I won't know everything about their jobs, and that's a good thing — we work in a field with a wide range of challenging disciplines — but when I start to lose touch with what great looks like, I'm unable to hold the right standard. 

Unfortunately, the more senior you get, the larger your [job matrix](../view_your_job_as_a_matrix/) gets, and it's hard to mentally stretch all the way from top to bottom. Because there is more redundancy toward the bottom of the matrix and less toward the top (leading the team is your job), hands-on technical work often ends up sacrificed first (and rightly so). 

I've observed that engineers seem to be better than data folks at tackling this tension by flipping back and forth between leadership and individual contributor roles, as described in the source of the quote above. Nearly every strong engineering leader got to where they are as a result of having very strong technical skills, and so perhaps it feels more uncomfortable more quickly to lose touch with those skills. This consistency of experience fosters a culture where flipping back and forth between leadership and IC roles is normalized, even celebrated. The architect role exists. Some CTOs even avoid having direct reports. Data leaders, on the other hand, come up through a wide range of paths, some of which (BI, analytics) may feel culturally quite distant from engineering. I'd love to see more examples in our field.
