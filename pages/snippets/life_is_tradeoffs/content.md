# Life is tradeoffs

The inverse of the old adage "when one door closes, another one opens" is also, unfortunately, true: when we choose to walk through one door, others tend to shut. It is not impossible, but generally quite challenging, to hold more than one full-time job, to live in more than one city/country, etc. Opportunities come with costs.

The decisions we make shape our days, weeks, years. We are constantly saying both "yes" and "no" to experiences, challenges, opportunities. We lose and we gain in equal measure (though as long as we know and act according to our own values, even the losses should feel ok).
