# Roll the marble back

Picture sitting behind a desk. Someone walks in the room, sits down across from you, and places a marble on the surface. It slowly rolls toward you and falls into your lap. You must now determine what you are going to do with this marble. You consider letting it fall from your lap onto the floor. It's not your marble. But the person across the desk from you says someone else is expecting that marble tomorrow. If dropped, it won't get where it needs to go. Your second option, then, is to deliver the marble. It's in your lap now, after all. But you look down and remember, you already have a lap full of marbles, many of which are much more important than this new marble. Your last option, then, is to roll the marble back. Next time, you might even consider tilting the desk before the marble even gets to you. Perhaps you could even put this desk on a permanent tilt, making it very hard for someone else to drop marbles in your lap. [[1]](#1)

Marbles are problems. The desk is the space you have to control which problems end up being your problems, and which ones you observe from a distance. 

If you lead a team, ensuring individuals are unblocked is a big part of the job. But [with too many marbles in your lap, it's hard to stand up and get moving](../view_your_job_as_a_matrix/). And, [if you hoard all the marbles, how will your team learn how to deal with them](../be_an_owner/)? [[2]](#2)

Sometimes, the best way to support your team is to tilt your desk. Roll the marble back before it can reach you. This doesn't mean leaving your team out to dry, but rather coaching them on how to deal with their own bag of marbles. Tip the desk back gently, degree by degree, question by question.

I didn't come up with this metaphor, and unfortunately I came across it some time before my note-taking system matured, so I have no idea who to credit. If you are familiar with the source, please let me know!

After moving into a leadership role, a sticky note with the phrase "roll the marble back" finally replaced that which had previously been on my computer monitor for several years. The original sticky note said "[be hypothesis driven](../be_hypothesis_driven/)."
