# Don't feel guilt over that mountain of unread books

> There are more books in the world than hours in which to read them. We are thus deeply influenced by books we haven't read, that we haven't had the time to read.

-- Umberto Eco

Certainly this is true on many levels. We are influenced by books that seep into our culture whether we've read them or not (you know the type â€” where you are pretty sure you could recite lines from the book despite having never cracked the spine of a single copy). We are influenced by the policies these books inspire. We are influenced by books via people in our orbit who act and think and speak differently owing to the books they have read. 

These are reasons you may want to read that mountain of books. They influence your life, thus it would be ideal to really understand them.

But the point of this snippet relates more to the flip side: not so much that you needn't read the books, as Eco somewhat [argues](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/11/02/on-unread-books/), but that it's beneficial to remember that you will never be _able_ to read all of the books you wish to read. Remembering this drives [humility](../humility_is_key_to_growth/). 

Nassim Nicholas Taleb refers to this concept as the "antilibrary."

> Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate market allows you to put there. You will accumulate more knowledge and more books as you grow older, and the growing number of unread books on the shelves will look at you menacingly. Indeed, the more you know, the larger the rows of unread books. Let us call this collection of unread books an antilibrary.

This framing hasn't discouraged me from reading the books on my shelves, but it has helped me feel freer to check out new books from the library despite the presence of those "menacing" spines that surround me. It's helped me feel less guilt over buying books for my brother-in-law, who is never as happy as when he receives a book as a gift and yet I can't imagine how he could possibly find time to read them all in between running a company and producing films and everything else he does. Above all else, every time I look at my shelves, I now think about this concept, and I am reminded to be humble in my knowledge.
