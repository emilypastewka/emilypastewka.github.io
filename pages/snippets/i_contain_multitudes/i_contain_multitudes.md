"I contain multitudes" is a [Bob Dylan song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgEP8teNXwY). 

Related (to become a separate snippet): I have heard [TV writers](https://podcasts.apple.com/mu/podcast/ep-232-sliding-doors-sarah-gets-chickens/id1236845161?i=1000539256927) discuss the concept of multiple potential lives as a [Sliding Doors](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120148/) idea. Still identity-related but with decision-making thrown in, more interesting (to me).
