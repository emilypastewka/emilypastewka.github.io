# Focus on one thing. Land it.

-- Jai Ranganathan, probably around 2018

I can't remember the context for this â€” a goodbye email full of advice, maybe? A response to a question during an ERG-hosted lunch? Whatever it was, I had a screenshot of it until recently when I converted all of my screenshots to markdown and somehow didn't think about all of the other context I'd lose in the process.

Anway, this always felt like great advice and I should probably come back to it more often. Ever since moving into higher-level leadership roles I've found it [harder to keep in mind](../view_your_job_as_a_matrix/) and yet, looking back, it's more true than ever.
