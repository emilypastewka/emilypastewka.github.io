# View your job as a matrix

The columns span the areas of the business you are responsible for / must think about.
The rows are the levels at which you operate, starting in the first row with tasks that ICs in your org might also be doing and moving up to influencing board/investors.

This framing is useful because your total responsibility set becomes quantifiable. Your job now has a clear geometric area calculation, a footprint. If it starts to feel too big, you have clear axes along which to cut or staff up.

It's similar to the idea of a [job leveling matrix](https://lattice.com/library/what-is-a-job-leveling-matrix) (career continuum, competency framework), and in fact combining the two would yield a more complete 3D view of your role, but it's easier to think in 2D. We essentially collapse skill & level into a single dimension by assuming that as a leader your level of achievement in that particular skill is on the far end of the spectrum ([engineering leaders do their jobs better when their technical skills remain relevant](../engineering_leaders_do_their_jobs_better_when_their_technical_skills_remain_relevant/)).

This view came to me during a conversation with a mentor. We were discussing how hard it is to stay hands-on in a codebase when success in your role also depends on exerting influence on executives â€” the cognitive cost of switching between the two types of thinking can be too high to sustain. Because there is more redundancy toward the bottom of the matrix and less toward the top (leading the team is your job), hands-on technical work often ends up sacrificed first.
