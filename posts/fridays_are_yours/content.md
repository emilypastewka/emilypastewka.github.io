# "Fridays are yours"

I've been [working at Black Crow AI](../ml_products_today_tomorrow/) for about 3 months now [[1]](#1), and in that time I've found there are 2 things friends, former colleagues, and candidates consistently want to know:
1. What's it really like working at an early-stage startup? (Or, if they already work at an early-stage startup: *are you surviving the transition?*)
2. Is the four-day work week real?

#1 deserves its own post, and will get one. Sneak peak: I'm loving it, it's hard, it's like nothing I've done before and yet I think my past experience set me up well. It helps that I joined a company full of experienced startup leaders who are open about the challenges we are all facing and invest time in supporting one another.

#2 feels particularly timely to discuss right now, however, given the recent wildfire on social media surrounding [the UK's 4-day workweek study](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60b956cbe7bf6f2efd86b04e/t/63f3df56276b3e6d7870207e/1676926845047/UK-4-Day-Week-Pilot-Results-Report-2023.pdf). 

Short answer: yes, it's real, and my experience lines up pretty well with many insights from the study. Black Crow‚Äôs version of the 4-Day week is to say ‚ÄúFridays are yours.‚Äù It‚Äôs a promise to never demand anything of an employee outside of Monday-Thursday, and it‚Äôs how 32% of companies in the study decided to approach the 4-day week. In addition to reporting on the number of companies that decided to continue with the 4-day week after the end of the trial period (30% permanently, 92% on some level), the authors detail benefits felt by both corporations and employees. The employee discussion focuses primarily on measures of health (stress, burnout, anxiety, fatigue, sleep) and work-life balance (relationships, time management with outside responsibilities). 

Long answer: while all of this resonates with me, it also doesn't capture my full experience. 

In addition to "life admin" and finding more time to enjoy my friends, family, and hobbies, I use my Fridays to maintain a wider view on my field that is critical for being an effective head of data. I can't imagine doing my job well without some version of this time available to me. Anyone who is head of their department is responsbile [not just for day-to-day operations but setting the vision for the future](../../pages/snippets/view_your_job_as_a_matrix/). It's impossible to do that when you're only thinking about what you're neck-deep in today. Effective leaders find ways to stay on top of the broader industry and bring those insights into their jobs. [[2]](#2)

At Rent the Runway, my most successful pattern was to read papers and listen to relevant podcasts during my commute. At Black Crow, I allocate time on Fridays for this instead. My Friday template looks like this:
- Take the dog out and then head straight for a nearby coffee shop, switching up my location to put my brain in a different mode. In these most creative morning hours, I write ‚Äî a mix of the types of things that show up in my [snippets](../../pages/snippets/) as well as journal exercises and creative pieces.
- Read a technical paper. I maintain a backlog of these, many of which are relevant to the things I'm actively working on, but often times I pull a paper that's simply interesting to me. Almost always they still end up yielding useful insights, if not immediately then down the road.
- Dive in on a [new technology](../../pages/snippets/engineering_leaders_do_their_jobs_better_when_their_technical_skills_remain_relevant/) or trial a tool that I haven't worked with. Again, sometimes these are things I've been mulling as additions to the stack at Black Crow. Other times, I'm just [curious](../../pages/snippets/humility_is_key_to_growth/) about something new and shiny, or that fellow data leaders have been talking up.
- Work out. During the week I work out first thing so that it's impossible to miss. On Fridays, that risk is much lower since my time is 100% in my control, so I have the luxury of working out when  my body feels best.
- Catch up with a friend, family member, former colleague, new connection. Sometimes these are scheduled in advance, sometimes I just see who answers the phone.
- Go out to dinner with my husband. Somehow at the end of a 5-day week he still has the energy for this; I rarely did over the past several years. Now, by Friday evening, I'm recharged. 

I don't do all of this every week. I aim to, because I like structure and know that all of these habits are valuable, but because my weekend is now consistently 3 days long I (a) know that I have another weekend day in which to do these things, if Friday isn't possible, and (b) sometimes try to use the 3-day weekend for something bigger than I could easily use a standard 2-day weekend for, like travel.

Some stats on what the first 3 months at Black Crow have actually looked like [[3]](#3):
- I have never been asked to join a meeting or respond to anything on a Friday.
- I have never asked my team to do anything on a Friday. 
- I've done some form of writing on 12 Fridays. 
- I've read 10 research papers (this does not include summaries from publications like Last Week in AI, which I also read most weeks).
- I've gone to 9 doctor/dentist/etc appointments (having a day off when doctors are still working made scheduling this much easier!).
- It appears I've pushed code only 3 times, but I've also pushed code on 5 Saturdays, which (knowing myself) implies I probably wrote code on closer to 8 Fridays.
- I've spent the day on an airplane 3 times (usually a morning flight, so I can actually have dinner with the people I'm visiting!).
- I've gone skiing 3 times.

Some things are harder to track ‚Äî I take notes on everything I read, but don't necessarily date them, so while I'd estimate I've done some reading nearly every week, I can't say for sure. Similarly, I schedule my workouts most weeks, but not always, so while I feel like I've done something active and enjoyable every week, I might not actually have 100% coverage.

Overall, I look at this list and feel so grateful to have this time. Even without the statistics in front of me, I would assert without question that this change has made me happier, healthier, saner, more creative, more successful, and more productive [[4]](#4). 

One stat from the UK study that stands out to many people is that, for 15% of participating employees, no amount of money could entice them to return to a 5-day work week. I'm not sure I fall in that camp. I am however certain that with this understanding of how much more effective I am when I'm making time for broader learning and growth, I will always aim to make that an intentional part of how I structure each week. For now, the 4-day week makes that very straightforward to accomplish.

Importantly, this doesn't just make me better at my current job. As a generalist with wide-ranging interests, learning outside of my daily field helps me keep on top of what else I could be doing with my time, so that I'm accurately contextualizing my current role and actively choosing it every day. It also ensures that when the time comes to leave it, I am confident in where I am heading next.
