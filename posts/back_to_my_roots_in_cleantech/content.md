# Back to My Roots in Cleantech

A few months ago, I spoke with Jon Krohn on the [Super Data Science Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S40w4qjl7UQ) about the role I hold today at [Palmetto Energy](https://palmetto.com/careers) and the data problems it puts in front of me. Since then, I've received many messages asking "how do I get into Climate Tech?" I love hearing from people who are curious about this space: it's exciting to realize how many friends, former colleagues, and complete strangers care the way I do about making a positive impact on the world through their work, and agree that climate problems are massive and worth dedicating oneself to addressing. It gives me increasing hope that the challenges are surmountable. But, as I stated [when I stood this site up](../why-now/), I'm not infinitely scalable. 

I sat down and synthesized the key takeaways from all these conversations, and four themes emerged:
* My personal decision process, or what I call "the wilderness year"
* Climate data problems
* The climate space from ten years ago through today
* The climate tech future

These topics are of course interrelated, but writing about them all together would result in one very long post, so I'll be sharing four. I hope they serve as a resource for anyone who identifies as climate-tech-curious.
1. [The Wilderness Year](../the_wilderness_year/)
