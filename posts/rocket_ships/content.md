# On Rocket Ships and Energy Sources


>If you're offered a seat on a rocket ship, don't ask what seat!

‚Äì Sheryl Sandberg

This is one of the most-quoted lines in Silicon Valley, and yet I can't be alone in how much I disagree with the advice. As with anything in life, your decisions should be made and actions should be taken with a purpose, a goal in mind. If your primary objective is to ride on a rocket ship, by all means, this advice makes sense. If your primary objective is to see your child grow up, first ask if you're signing up for a seat with a return journey. If your primary objective is to be an expert pilot, first ask if your seat puts you anywhere near the controls. 

What's more, not all rockets are the same. Some rockets will go to the ISS, others will go to the moon, still others target Mars. Some rockets are built by well-funded organizations and are more likely to survive takeoff. 

If you ride on any given rocket, someone will probably be interested in hiring you for other jobs later. My Uber background definitely shows me that [[1]](#1). But I chose the Uber rocket for a reason, and I chose every seat I took on that rocket very carefully [[2]](#2).

Recently, people have been asking me about my move back into climate tech, and I've been reflecting on [how I made my decision](../back_to_my_roots_in_cleantech/). I opted to get back on a rocket, and I was once again very intentional about choosing which craft I would ride on and what seat I would take.

# Rockets in Climate Tech

Every craft flying around climate tech is in for a heck of a ride. The industry may be charting an [unstable course](https://www.ctvc.co/state-of-climate-tech-in-h1-2024-204) that no modern rocket scientist would be particularly proud of, but it's spawning all sorts of aircraft and spacecraft with compelling missions. This is especially true when we zoom in to the energy industry, which is one of the two major categories that really factor in to our ability to meet major climate goals [[3]](#3). As Packy writes in [one of my favorite thought pieces of the last few years](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-morality-of-having-kids-in-a), "If you squint, human history looks like a big, long game called ENERGY." Not long before that he wrote, even more simply, "[Energy is prosperity.](https://www.notboring.co/p/weekly-dose-of-optimism-64)"

The other big boom on my (everyone's) radar is, of course, AI. While [constraints drive creativity](https://www.oprah.com/spirit/how-to-unleash-your-creativity/2), and thus the [cost and environmental impact of the energy required to train LLMs and other foundation models](https://tinyml.substack.com/p/the-carbon-impact-of-large-language) [[4]](#4) are leading to [rapid improvements in training efficiency](https://unsupervisedlearning.substack.com/i/131782459/how-much-have-training-costs-decreased) and [openness in sharing methods and artifacts](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/), [tech companies risk missing their climate goals](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-11/big-tech-s-climate-goals-at-risk-from-massive-ai-energy-demands). AI innovation focused on efficiency is not enough, and [halting progress in AI development is certainly not the answer](../../pages/snippets/solutions_orientation/). Clean energy sources and supporting technologies are thus more important than ever. As Bessemer Ventures write in their [Climate and Energy Software Roadmap](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/roadmap-climate-and-energy-software), "The transition from fossil fuels to clean energy generation and electrification will be one of the largest wealth transitions of our lifetime."

I want to be on a rocket in the Energy galaxy.

# Sitting in the Data Seat
In addition, I'm still a data person who loves building consumer products. This is what fuels me (_ha-ha_), where I do my best work. I looked at [what data problems exist](../energy_tech_data_problems/) across energy companies, and not all companies have a seat focused on the problems I love to dig in on. 

I also love leading the data function, having responsibility for not just DS/ML or analytics but data engineering, data product development, and business strategy. 

It takes a little bit of luck to be open to new opportunities at the same time that the right rocket ship opens up the right seat. [Life is tradeoffs](../../pages/snippets/life_is_tradeoffs/): some people might settle on one of these dimensions for very good reasons. 

I didn't.

Including declining an initial offer in 2012 to do customer support. I have looked back and regretted that decision, who wouldn't? But I also feel fairly certain I would've quit before I even vested my first cliff. Customer support in 2012 was a grueling 18-hour day with a ticket-answering quota in the hundreds. Yes, most people doing it had a bachelors degree (at least) and years of work experience. Kudos to those who took the opportunity and made it work. I spent the years working on my data skills and landed the role I wanted when Uber was still plenty young.

The other being agriculture. Great listen [here](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/is-green-growth-possible/id1548604447?i=1000654026134).
