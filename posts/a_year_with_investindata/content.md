# Learnings from A Year with InvestInData

About a year ago one of my good friends and favorite past managers asked if I'd like to join an angel investing syndicate of other heads of data, cross-cutting across all different industries, company sizes, and types of people. The idea is that as the people constantly deciding what data tools we want to buy, and leading the teams who use those tools, the members of [InvestInData](https://www.investindata.ai/) have an edge on the average VC approaching and evaluating these companies — both in terms of the quality of our decisions, and our ability to offer founders more than just a check. After meeting a few more members of the team and getting to understand more about how the group operates, I accepted, and with a year of investing under my belt, I'm reflecting on what I've learned and continue to learn [[1]](#1).

## Why me?
Asking "why was I invited to join this group?" helps me recognize what I should keep doing if I want to continue seeing interesting opportunities open up. [[2]](#2) In this case:
- As head of the data function for several years at a number of different companies, I've been in the buyer's seat for all sorts of data software decisions, giving me a lot of opportunity to think about why I prefer one vendor over another and in what situations, to understand pricing, to weigh in on roadmaps.
- I worked and kept in touch with a number of the great people who founded this group. The Uber data diaspora is real.
- I clearly care about startups. I was working for one at the time (Black Crow AI), I've sought and given advice about [tools](https://www.statsig.com/testimonials?source=collection_about----------------------------------------) I needed and tools I [loved](https://www.prefect.io/blog/rtr-struts-the-data-runway-with-prefect) throughout my tenure as a data leader, heck, I even married a founder who went through YC and saw his first exit after a ten-year grind. I have a lot of respect and love for the people putting the grueling hours in to bring useful, delightful products to life, and a lot of expertise on those specifically targeted at data teams.

## Why say yes?
InvestInData is not most people's full-time gig, so the decision wasn't about leaving an existing job, but [my time is still scarce](../../pages/snippets/time_is_currency/). InvestInData takes up between one and ten hours per week for most people, depending where we are in an investment cycle. Members are expected to always be sourcing, and active on Slack. There is also a quarterly investment cadence, which consists of synchronous meetings to select candidate companies, hear pitches, and organize due diligence on companies in which we're considering investing. It's not huge, but it's both constant and spiky — nontrivial to manage on top of a full-time leadership role.

I accepted for a number of reasons. 

**Edge**

First, the pitch resonated with me. I've had VCs reaching out to me for years asking what I thought of company X, idea Y — why shouldn't I be putting that knowledge to use beyond my own software purchasing decisions and advice to my network? 

GGV Capital, who help run the group, have been successfully running a similar group for CISOs for a number of years, so there was evidence that this could work. 

**Impact & engagement with startups**

I love dreaming up and building the future, and IID [[3]](32) provides the chance to be part of that process with more startups than just the one I work for full-time, as a design partner or even just as a trusted Angel. I've long said that I prefer to [build](../../pages/snippets/be_an_owner/) things than tell others how to do so, but companies who choose to take investment from IID are excited about access to the collection of data leaders with expertise in their space. They know we've built our own versions of solutions to the problems they're tackling, and seek to work with us with that experience in mind. Before choosing to join, I met with the CEO of a portfolio company who told me conversations with IID had been instrumental in convincing him to make a risky pivot. Founders who come to IID are not generally looking for the relatively small amount of money we contribute: they come to IID seeking true partnership.

**Broaden view of landscape**

My inbox is constantly full of pitches, my LinkedIn and HackerNews and ProductHunt are full of congratulatory launch posts, but I expected being part of IID to tune my attention to these things more consistently. In addition, the constant discussion of the data SaaS landscape with other data leaders and investors from [diverse backgrounds](../../pages/snippets/build_teams_of_t_shapes/) would provide additional layers to my mental model. 

**Peers**

In addition to discussing startups & their products, the IID community seemed like a phenomenal network of like-minded people who I expected I would enjoy getting to know and learning from across the board. Since leaving Uber for smaller startups, I've missed the access to a large group of colleagues thinking about the same problems as I have on my mind. I lead my entire function now: nobody at my company knows the ins and outs of my job, nor should they. [It's lonely at the top](../../pages/snippets/leadership_is_a_burden/). Informal networks like a WhatsApp thread of former Uber data leaders have been great, and I keep in touch with friends from all over the industry, but the structure of specific shared problem statements with associated financial interests had the potential to provide deeper insights day in and day out. 

**Learning a new discipline**

Finance has always been a tangential career interest of mine [[4]](#4), and private equity in particular becomes more and more interesting as time passes. Who decides which companies get a shot, and how? Watching cycles of tech development, money, and media I've found that turns of events that would've bewildered a younger me now frequently make sense.  It's also struck me increasingly that [each career choice I make is a big bet](../valuations_mar2022/), whereas financial investors spread their risk out.

I've always loved finding ways to test into things before jumping in fully. IID might help me learn how a background in tech and skills with data translate to this related field.


## What have I learned in a year?
Having spelled out my [investment thesis](../../pages/snippets/be_hypothesis_driven/), how's it going?

**Edge**

I have no evidence yet whether IID does or doesn't have an edge on the broader VC community when it comes to data tooling — IID invests in mostly pre-seed through Series A companies, so exits aren't expected for years to come. I have however observed strong leading indicators: founders with top-tier backgrounds and prior investments from big-name VCs still come to IID because we offer something meaningful; at least one company the group invested in before I joined appears to be growing very quickly. 

David and I decided that we'd invest a set amount in each company the group agrees on, in line with the principle on which the group was founded. Despite that agreement, I sat out one investment early on that didn't land with me. I regret going against my investment principle. I don't plan to do so again. 

**Impact & engagement with startups**

In addition to the several investments we made in the past year, IID had made several intestments before I joined the group. Because founders come to IID specifically for guidance, we make ourselves very available as a rule, and many teams take advantage of that. 

Since I'm at least as interested in learning about these companies as I am in furthering my financial interests, I've spent time with teams from companies who joined the fold both before and after I did. Conversations have ranged both in modality and focus. Some engagement takes place asynchronously, over Slack threads on topics like "does this framing of the challenges with time series EDA resonate with you?" Other times a founder will reach out for a 1:1 call, having noticed something about my background that makes them want specific input on a problem they're currently facing, or wanting to go deeper on a comment I've made. I've also added value by referring people in my network to jobs with portfolio companies, as well as making connections to potential design partners and paying customers.

Seeing my network and knowledge [multiplying value](https://thewisemangroup.com/books/multipliers/) is deeply satisfying, but I've learned at least as much as I've contributed through these interactions. Great founders are constantly scanning the market to understand what problems their customers are facing and how they might be solved, and in our conversations I get to see how my specific experience fits in to the bigger picture in the world of data today.


**Broaden view of landscape**

I'm always looking for new tools that may be useful to my company or my [side projects](../../pages/snippets/engineering_leaders_do_their_jobs_better_when_their_technical_skills_remain_relevant/). No question, IID has helped me find more of them with less effort, and make more informed decisions about which will suit my needs and tradeoffs on different dimensions. 

IID has also pushed me to continue spending time with tools and technologies outside of my direct needs at work. Exposure to such a wide range of upcoming tools & technologies helps me think about [what the future may hold, and how that may impact my work](../ml_products_today_tomorrow/).

One of the biggest themes of the year has been — no surprise — generative AI. The entire world is trying to figure out the potential for this technology, and data leaders are expected to lead the way for their companies. IID has vetted companies seeking to apply generative AI in a multitude of ways, but especially focused on the data stack: can end users talk directly to their data, bypassing a need to write SLQ? might data engineers avoid ever writing a custom pipeline again? how can we as genAI developers most easily work with open source models? engineer prompts? avoid hallucinations? Listening to global experts on generative AI is one thing; getting to debate how to harness its power with this group of technical experts is far better.

**Peers**

IID is the best network of data leaders I've yet had access to.

Having another Slack to keep up with can be tiring, but it keeps me in close and constant contact with founders of our portfolio companies, the GGV team, and the group of Angels. We share news about venture capital, startups, incumbents, and technical advances; we seek input from one another on vendor decisions and how we approach challenges at work; we deep dive on hot topics and emerging trends. 

At times, the group can also make me envious. I'm Head of Data at a company fairly early on our data journey. We are not a pure tech company, and data is a key support to critical day-to-day operations. It's very different from past roles, where I've led cutting edge machine learning engineering and product groups. While I know I'm building toward that at my current company, it can be tough to see others deep in the weeds of the problems I'm itching to tackle while I steadily build my team's foundations.

That said, I also see within this group that no single data leader is actively working on every new hot technology, and there are a number of people, like me, are more focused on the fundamentals of data platforms and semantic layers than they are on generative AI or distributed data processing. The reality of the head of data role is that the less sexy pieces of the job are critical to [land](../../pages/snippets/focus_on_one_thing_land_it/) [[5]](#5).

**Learning a new discipline**

Pulling apart patterns is one of the most satisfying aspects of data science. Applying that mental approach to the startup landscape and how to allocate time and money has been deeply satisfying, and also humbling. 

VC investing all starts with sourcing, and I was pleased to find that I might be good at this. My network gives me access to good ideas and great founders, and my background informs a discerning eye. One of the four companies IID invested in this past year was a company I sourced. I've caught a few other founders too late relative to their fundraising timelines, but got validation from other members of IID that they would've been excited by those opportunities. Being really great at this will take more time and dedication, and it's something that I plan to lean in on in the coming years.

Due diligence has also been a highlight. I've enjoyed sourcing & sifting through information to build a [cogent narrative](../../pages/snippets/write_for_thought/), parsing my opinions from the facts. 

I have yet to develop as much confidence in making final decisions about companies. Over the coming year, I look forward to running more retrospectives on decision-making, so that I can hone this skill. I joke that I have "founder goggles" — I love to be shown a vision of a brighter future [[6]](#6). I also try to remind myself that my vote is just [one of many](../../pages/snippets/humility_is_key_to_collaboration/) in this group, and it's our [collective wisdom](../../pages/snippets/transactive_memory/) that we believe gives us an edge, but I still track how my votes match up against the aggregate and am surprised at where I've deviated from the mean. One thing I've realized is that not only do we have different backgrounds, but we also optimize for different things: some people just want to get closer to a technology, others are really focused on the financial return and won't get excited about a company with an already-high valuation. We can probably get tighter on our shared vision.

I've also been getting [more questions](../why-now/) about this since mentioning it on [The Super Data Science Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S40w4qjl7UQ).

On a phone call from the ISS, Scott Kelly asked Tom Wolfe how to approach writing his story. Tom replied, "start at the beginning." It's always good advice. On a total tangent: I'm a huge fan of both [Endurance](http://www.scottkelly.com/endurance) and [The Bonfire of the Vanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bonfire_of_the_Vanities).

Duke didn't have a Finance program back in 2008, so studying Economics was a well-trod path to Wall Street. I was the only honors graduate not heading that direction. I ended up reporting to Uber's CFO for three years anyway, and loved every minute of it. 

I have since spent time with my undergrad Econ thesis advisor discussing how the degree could be more meaningful for those interested in studying economics for use in other fields. I've advised a transition to more open source programming languages, and shared my experience applying econometrics to data science as a resource to building up a stronger program for students interested in a career in tech.

My boss at Rent the Runway told me he thought my job at the time (head of machine learning) was more fun than his, and I didn't quite see it then. I get it now.

As the GGV investors remind me, an ultra compelling founder is actually a great reason to invest, especially at early stages
