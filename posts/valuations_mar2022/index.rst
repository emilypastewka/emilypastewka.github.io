I’ve watched friends of mine do very well over the years as early engineers at young startups like Uber, Slack, Figma, Cloud Kitchens, Coinbase. I’ve also watched friends join startups that fail, or bop along barely surviving, certainly not minting millionaires. I won’t name them, because you won’t have heard of most, and those you have will come off as making fun, which I’m not here to do, but this latter list is longer than the former.

I can name more than a few engineers who have both types of companies on their resume, so it’s safe to say it’s not about some people being smarter than others and choosing well. Well, you might say, I’m sure they didn’t leave the startup that’s killing it, which means they got there after learning from failure. This is hindsight bias. To quote Annie Duke in her book Thinking in Bets, “What makes a decision great is not that it has a great outcome. A great decision is the result of a good process.” That same good process could pair with bad luck and lead to a bad outcome, or pair with good luck and lead to a good outcome. My question is: what is a good process today?
