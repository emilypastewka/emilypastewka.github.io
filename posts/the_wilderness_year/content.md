# The Wilderness Year

The continuous uphill charge of tech in the 2010s began encountering knockdown after knockdown starting in 2020, and rolling with the punches is wearing people out. If you're one of those people, you might think climate tech is not for you. But maybe, like me, it's exactly what you need. 

2020 wasn't the first time tech saw a decline — the dot com bust is still part of our common reference book — but ever fewer people who worked through that cycle are still working today. Cleantech, on the other hand, has cycled up and down [multiple times](https://etechmonkey.com/index.php/2020/04/21/clean-tech-boom-and-bust-will-history-repeat-itself/) since the year 2000. Almost everyone I know in the field has experienced a downturn. The decision to work in this field is a decision to grapple constantly with uncertainty. And if you work in the field because you care deeply about the purpose of your work, it's a decision to grapple constantly with your emotions. But if you're going to struggle with change-driven challenges anywhere you work, as we've been reminded since 2020, why not work on something you care deeply about? 

I started my career in climate and veered off - slowly at first, then suddenly and dramatically - before returning a year ago. The down cycle I experienced 2014-2015 was hard, but the time I spent working outside the space was difficult too, in a way that took me years to name. I ultimately realized that seeing failure up close on issues I care about was a price worth paying to work in accordance with my values. In this field, being part of the failure means being part of the team that gets back up to go again, every time. [Life is curveballs](../../pages/snippets/life_is_curve_balls/), and I'd rather take a swing at them in this field than anywhere else. This is the story of how I figured that out.


## Into the Unknown

In 2022, my life looked as good as it ever had, and yet I felt completely lost. I didn't know exactly what questions I was asking at the time, but I threw myself into finding answers. I took risks, made changes, suffered, and learned. Looking back, I refer to this time as my "[wilderness year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill%27s_%22Wilderness%22_years,_1929%E2%80%931939)."

**The enormity of the wilderness**

The first risk I took was leaving my prestigious and fun job at Rent the Runway for an unpaid [sabbatical](../time_off_nov2022/). I left the country for the summer, fully apart from all of my friends and family (except my cat, travel queen that she is). It was a privilege to be able to take this time, but the experience was also destabilizing. It gave me the time and space to ask big questions that had nowhere to bubble up when my mind was fully dedicated to my job. It was the time I used to finish my Master's thesis, freeing me to consider where my time would go next. I decided it wouldn't be Rent the Runway, but it took a while for me to find further direction. Like the wilderness, the options in front of me felt overwhelmingly large and challenging to navigate. 

**Geographic and intellectual wilderness**

After wrapping up my sabbatical, my husband and I decided to take a second risk: we left New York and moved to Colorado. I love New York for what it is, but my happiness depends on proximity to nature that the boroughs don't offer. We considered a return to San Francisco, the first place I truly felt home and the epicenter of both of our tech careers, but Colorado had recently become the epicenter of our family, and it provides as much access to nature as the Bay Area does. We decided to give it a try: if, after a year, it wasn't working, we would continue west. 

The first few months were a tough adjustment. I indulged in long trail runs and hikes and powder days, but even as I made new friends who valued these same outdoorsy hobbies, I worried that I had strayed too far from people who shared my career ambitions. I was feeling especially distant from the tech zeitgeist: my area of expertise seemed to be taking over the world [[1]](#1), a bigger buzz than "big data" in 2012. How could I not be in SOMA with all the other young technologists, figuring out the future of generative AI? 

I came to realize two things:
1. The mental space I've created for myself in a place with a slower pace of life gives me more energy to work on side projects and explore cutting edge tech and big ideas on my own time. I don't overhear founders pitching their startups at every coffee shop, but I have the bandwidth to [really dig into new products on the market, new ideas](../a_year_with_investindata/), and figure out my own opinions and beliefs. Tech is global and largely remote these days; where I am physically matters less than where I am mentally, and I'm more present than ever. 
2. With that bandwidth, the time I spent really thinking about generative AI led me to think about what types of problems I really cared to apply it to. The companies being funded sparked my interest as a technologist, but I didn't think any would leave a legacy. I became far more interested in potential second-order effects: would generative AI ultimately free humanity to focus on bigger problems? What problems would those be, and, once freed, were we prepared to tackle them?

**Identity: Lost and Found**

The third big risk I took in 2022 was accepting a job at [Black Crow AI](../ml_products_today_tomorrow/). In addition to reasons I expected the company to be successful, my investment thesis included [hypotheses](../../pages/snippets/be_hypothesis_driven/) around personal growth. One of those hypotheses [[2]](#2) was that I would be happier working at a company that wasn't so mission-driven. I believed it would let me relax more easily outside of work hours, be less invested in my work, turn that energy to other pursuits and passions. As it turns out, I invest myself deeply in my work for many reasons, not just because I care about a company's mission. I invest myself deeply in my work because I want to be proud to produce great things, because I want to be an expert in my space. I invest myself in my work because I respect my colleagues, and I see the work they put in. Upon realizing these truths, and that I like these things about myself, I had to ask: is all of that investment returning enough? For me, the answer was no. 

When I shared my decision to leave with colleagues, I learned that many of them care similarly deeply about the climate challenges we face. People told me they feel more able to spend time outside of work on these problems when they can compartmentalize their work life, or that they plan to take their startup exit earnings and funnel them to solutions. They're approaching climate action as a second-order outcome. I understand and respect those approaches. What I learned about myself is that they don't work for me. [[3]](#3)

As I tell my teams: learning from a failed experiment is a good thing. It can feel like you wasted time, put enormous effort into something that just gets scrapped, but great product orgs celebrate failed experiments because they know how much knowledge they've gained from running them. [[4]](#4)

## Return from the wilderness

I tell myself I've never had a [big dream](https://www.loc.gov/programs/poetry-and-literature/poet-laureate/poet-laureate-projects/poetry-180/all-poems/item/poetry-180-133/the-summer-day/), but that's not true. It may not be as showy as the dreams some of my friends have had. I clearly haven't had the confidence to pursue it whole-heartedly for my entire life. Certainly, I have [many interests and passions](../../pages/snippets/i_contain_multitudes/) that sometimes [conflict](../../pages/snippets/life_is_tradeoffs/). But from the [hippie camp](https://greenriverpreserve.org/about-us) I went to as a kid to the [undergraduate](https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/items/979c20e6-4033-485e-a0bb-beec39814179) and [graduate](https://www.cosmos-lab.org/) research that kept me indoors when all my peers were out having fun, climate change mitigation has always been a through line. 

Once I realized that leaving climate had been a failed experiment, I started to follow cleantech news more closely [[5]](#5). I caught up with friends and former colleagues. I called everyone who would speak with me[[6]](#6). Eventually, the offer to lead Data at [Palmetto](https://www.linkedin.com/company/palmetto/about/) pulled together everything I know best: consumer product, marketplace optimization, energy data. It offered a chance to work with former Uber colleagues who I respected immensely, and with [people who had been in the industry for a decade or more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7170463205465546754/), empowered with solid funding to tackle big, hard problems [[7]](#7).

Someone asked me recently if I actually feel the impact of what I'm doing every day, or if it's just like any other job. I shared this:
>My first day at Palmetto, the company all hands was about sales, and my gut reaction was, "this is not fun." And then I remembered: we sell solar. Every sale is equivalent to nearly 5,000 kg fossil fuels unburned. 

So yes, I spend a lot of time on standard business problems like sales. But I absolutely feel the impact every day. 

And on a really good day, I'm working directly with energy data, or thinking about problems far beyond solar. And that's what I'll get into in the next posts in this series.

The other hypotheses:
- I wanted to be more hands-on. I invested in my leadership skills for a long time, and didn't want to lose my technical chops. This was a great decision. Working alone on side projects is one thing; designing systems with a team of engineers and shipping production code requires that you operate on another level entirely. I was recently told some of my models are still in production. My roadmaps are still in use at Rent the Runway, too. It feels good to know I'm leaving useful tools behind.
- I wanted to own the core product at a company. [My work at both Uber and Rent the Runway had been important to core product and company success](../../pages/snippets/where_does_your_company_make_money/), but ultimately, Uber provides transportation, and Rent the Runway provides clothing. Black Crow, on the other hand, provides AI, and I ran the team building it. I expected this to put me under extreme pressure, and it did. I rose to that challenge and loved it. I should have known: I love to [be an owner](../../pages/snippets/be_an_owner/).
- I wanted to try out working at an early stage startup. This was hard, even harder than I'd expected (even after seeing it at close-range, living with a founder for 7 years). The fast pace, need to figure so many things out on my own, and extreme uncertainty challenged me on new levels. I created systems to handle the first two and got them under control. The latter was harder to tame, but I'd been very thoughtful about my decision to join Black Crow, and the more time I spent with the rest of the leadership team, the more my uncertainty faded. Obstacles arose, and we met them.

I actually stayed on as an advisor for another 6 months, recruiting a former Uber colleague as my backfill and helping her settle into the role. The team is still [killing it](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/genai-hackathon-2023-key-take-aways-how-build-chat-bot-hugo-ducruc-gm2uf/?utm_source=rss&utm_campaign=articles_sitemaps).

Throwing myself into a new field was not good experimental design, but based on observations made in the year since drawing conclusions, I stand behind them.

When I say anyone, I mean it. I do have a strong network in this field, but I also wasn't afraid to ask a friend of a friend, the spouse of a former colleague, to get on the phone. 

If you look within 2 or 3 degrees of separation and still don't have that kind of network, there are also very active communities out there:
- [Terra.do](www.terra.do) runs events
- [Work On Climate](workonclimate.org) has an active Slack group

My first job offer out of college was actually in solar, and I said no. At the time, it felt too risky, and that was a fair assessment. Solar had a rough ride for a long time. But just listen to one Ezra Klein episode on climate, or on China, and you'll hear the mix of frustration and optimism. [Solar radiation makes up 99.98% of the earth's energy budget](https://www.coursera.org/learn/renewable-energy-technology-fundamentals)! How can we possibly ignore it?
