# Why Now

I interviewed for my first data role at a tech company the same month [HBR](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century) deemed "data scientist" the "sexiest job of the 21st century,” which means my career is roughly the same age as the modern field of data. For better or worse, we grew up together. Over the last decade I've built algorithms and teams solving problems in [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opower), [logistics](https://eng.uber.com/) and [sustainable fashion](https://dresscode.renttherunway.com/). 

The tech is still fun and new. The people problems are harder, probably because the stakes are so much higher. I spend a lot of time mentoring younger people just getting their start in the data field — I manage several teams of scientists & engineers (though not all of them are younger than I am, and that's a post for another time), I'm responsive on LinkedIn, I do annual panels with multiple organizations at my undergrad and frequent follow-up chats with students I meet during those sessions, I like to share my experiences with people at bootcamps and podcasts and conferences, and for many years I led Girls Who Code groups in Oakland and San Francisco [[1]](#1). This has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my career. It just doesn't scale well. I find myself offering to talk to people on weekends, late at night, early in the morning. I find myself repeating the same things over and over. And I hate when a conversation is too short to get into really meaningful problems on someone's mind [[2]](#2).

I still want to talk to you. I get a ton of value out of relationships with my mentors in the data space. But as much as I enjoy our phone and video calls, sometimes the quick text or email exchange that results in a book or blog post recommendation is enough to unstick me. My goal is for this space to get the contents of some of the more common conversations I have (and the conversations I wish I was having) out in the open for the benefit of anyone in data/tech, but especially those whose journey started after mine. Added bonus that I am a self-described "slow processor," so writing things down is a favorite method of clarifying exactly what's going on in my own brain. Ten years in, I might know enough that it’s occasionally worth doing so publicly.

I'm also a human with hobbies and interests and struggles outside of work. This will probably be a place to honor and process some of that too.

[I also write for my own clarity](../../pages/snippets/write_for_thought/), and making some of that writing public enables me to get valuable feedback.
