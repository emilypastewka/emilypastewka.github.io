# Celebrating YC

Y Combinator’s 20th birthday party, hosted at their headquarters in SOMA and attended by founders with 10x-its [[1]](#1), was the type of event that makes me miss living in San Francisco — but hey, we flew back for it, as did many other alumni from as early as the very first cohort.

Though I've worked almost exclusively at private companies throughout my career, now that I'm working on a particularly early-stage venture — launching Palmetto's enterprise software division [[2]](#2) — the night was also a great reminder of who makes it in the startup world:

- People who truly love to build. The idea of “make something people want” is what gets great entrepreneurs started and what keeps them going, wherever the original plan takes them. Even post-exit, most founders I spoke to have another [“interesting project”](https://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html) they’ve sunk their teeth into.

- People with the [humility](../../pages/snippets/humility_is_key_to_growth/) to take the advice of mentors and peers — and the slightly unhinged optimism to block out non-believers. “The best hackers these days are coming straight out of high school, they’re so open to new AI” sums this up perfectly: respect for skill and insight wherever it comes from, and no fear of the future.

- People who make different decisions than the average person would in all sorts of little ways. New ideas were followed by having the “plums” to test them out — business models, marketing schemes, personal life plans, and (at least last night) all sorts of sartorial risks.

Proud of David, and equally inspired to keep building the future-oriented, slightly crazy things we’re working on at [Palmetto](https://palmetto.com/energy-intelligence) + funding other future-oriented, slightly crazy builders through [InvestInData](https://www.linkedin.com/company/investindata/).

As we learned that night, also known as "[black t-shirt](https://x.com/bchesky/status/1469481491637825538) founders."

Ok, so it's a startup within a startup — easier in some ways, harder in others. I probably owe a full post on that another time.
